                            <h4>SIMD uses only one instruction to process a large amount of data or 
                                multiple data sets at the same time. For example, the instructions state 
                                to add 1 to the data, which is 4, 5, and 6. While the MIMD applies multiple 
                                instructions to multiple data sets at the same time. So, instead of adding 1 
                                to 4, 5, and 6, we will add 1 to 4, 2 to 5, 3 to 6, and so on. In terms of performance, 
                                SIMD is less efficient and requires less memory.</h4>

                            <h2>1. How does parallel programming/computing works? What do you think will be the advantage of utilizing parallel approach?</h2>
                            <h4>the parallel computing is a technique of dividing a problem into smaller task that can be executed at the same time by 
                                utilizing numerous computer resources. For example, when we want to plot a graph or build a table of data, instead of 
                                doing it one at a time, we may display more points of the graph or fill more fields of the table at once when we do it 
                                in parallel. Parallel computing also provides speedier performance and allows us to run code more effectively, saving 
                                time and money.</h4>

                            <h4>the serial computing is a kind of processing that uses a single processor to 
                                accomplish one task at a time, whereas parallel computing can use multiple 
                                processors to do multiple tasks at the same time. an example of this is when 
                                we are teaching someone while drawing and there's two types to do it. the first 
                                one is we can sketch first before explaining what we've drawn. then second is we 
                                can explain to someone while we are drawing. Serial computing is also slower than 
                                parallel computing and there are barely a little remaining who still use it.</h4>
